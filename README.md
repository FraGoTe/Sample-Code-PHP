Sample-Code-PHP
===============
A sample of a SOAP enabled class in PHP (Zend Framework).

This is a Zend model/controller from a current work project written by me (Jack Brain). This class pair is responsible for authentication 
and the handling of incoming SOAP requests to retrieve application data and submit XML to the application to complete the specified tasks.

The story you are about to see is true, the variables have been changed to protect the innocent.
